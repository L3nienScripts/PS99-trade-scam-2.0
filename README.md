# PS99-trade-scam-2.0

Brand new Pet simulator 99 trade scam script.

Usage:

1. forces other player to accept trade no matter what
2. trades a non existent pet for the other player's ACTUAL pet
How the script does that:

1. Using a remote event in the server
2. Using a server sided visual script that shows on the other player's client side
Disclaimer: Script is currently in BETA 2.0 version and thus is free and open to the public for testing. Might not be compatible with all executors.

P.S. Also looking for youtubers to showcase my script. Contact me at @jaz_0001 on discord
